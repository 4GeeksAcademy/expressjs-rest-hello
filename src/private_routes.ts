/**
 * Pivate Routes are those API urls that require the user to be
 * logged in before they can be called from the front end.
 * 
 * Basically all HTTP requests to these endpoints must have an
 * Authorization header with the value "Bearer <token>"
 * being "<token>" a JWT token generated for the user using 
 * the POST /token endpoint
 * 
 * Please include in this file all your private URL endpoints.
